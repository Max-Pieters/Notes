A simplified formal definition of a game can look as follows:

Players (P, O)
The current state of the game
State transition actions

In combat, the thing that we want to balance and make interesting is the state transition actions. We can explore a few scenarios, and see what ideas we come up with for actions players (and enemies!) can take. 

Let's consider the following:

1. The player has been spotted by a single, relatively weak enemy.
2. The player has just entered a level. There are several enemies throughout, that can be engaged with one-on-one.
3. The player is fighting a boss that has a lot of health.
4. Two groups are fighting eachother.
