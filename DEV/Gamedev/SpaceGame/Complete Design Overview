2. Movement & Combat

3. Navigation
Spacegame is a linear, quasi-open game. Some areas are open navigable spaces, where the player roams freely to points of interest. Some levels have an explicit sense of diretion, ie a section of enemies that need to be traversed, an exit to be reached, or a point of interest that needs to be reached within a short span of time.

4. Ship building

Of the rebel faction, ships tend to be repurposed utility vehicles. As such, they tend to be hatched together from stolen, repurposed, and improvised source. The component system should reflect this.

Attatching a component should have the following conditions:
1. Stat upgrades (ie +10 acceleration)
2. Special abilities (ie dash ability)
3. Cost  (Potential to explode)
4. Limitations (can only be attached to)
