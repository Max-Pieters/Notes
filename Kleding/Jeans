Jeans are made of tightly woven cotton. The weave and the texture are a big part of the material. The dye of choice is usually indigo, although grey and black dyes are not uncommon.

Historic brands include:
Levi's
Wrangler
Lee's
Diesel

Washing decides how heavy the jeans are dyed. These washes can fade in places, resulting in cool and unique patterns. Frequent cleaning will result in even and gradual fades in the jeans. Infrequent washing will result in wild and unique fading where there is the most stress.
