Guitar
    Harley Benton CG45 (DISREPAIR)
    Bought for too much. Not bad, though. The neck is currently warped.

    Squier Affinity Telecaster (SOLD)
    This was my first electric guitar. It was in butterscotch blonde.

    Squier PJ Affinity Bass
    My first bass! Not bad, but needs some mods.

    Ibanez AS 53 
    A bit scuffed, at this point. The pickups were replaced so that I could add covers, but these pickups are actually way worse and brighter.

    Ibanez Acoustic (SOLD)
    Was fine. Had it at my parents house. I sold it when I no longer needed it.

    Yamaha CP40 (BROKEN)
    This thing was a bit shit, bit it was mine. I wanted to replace the bridge with a rosewood one. Big fuckin' mistake. I broke this one appart in the name of science.

    Squier Classic Vibe Stratocaster (SOLD)
    Really great.

    Ibanez GRS Five String (SOLD)
    I bought it broken, and sold it at a profit. Wasn't a huge fan. There wasn't a great fan of the bass boost

    Parts Telecaster 
    Great thing

    Alvarez MD 60 
    My favourite acoustic guitar. Pretty much an accurate D18 copy. It was awful to get, though.

    Garbage Classical (SOLD)
    This thing was not good, but I really wanted a temporary classical guitar after the Yamaha broke.

    Prudencio Saez Modelo .132
    I love this thing. It has Madagascar Rosewood back and sides. Needs to be tinkered with, though.

    Parts Stratocaster
    I also love this thing.

    Hofner Model 483 Parlor
    Ladder bracing, solid spruce top, with flamed maple and mahogany laminate back and sides.

    Ibanez AR300
    It's alright. Bought to be sold.

Synthesizer
    Korg Volca Keys (SOLD)
    Cool little toy, but not something I wanted to keep

    Behringer Model D
    Pretty damn good
