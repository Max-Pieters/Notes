Heist On Hitler
    Back To The Future X Inglorious Bastards
    
    In an alternate history, the Nazis won. They assimilate entire cultures and kill all who resists or are deemed unworthy of assimilation. A tiny resistance group invents a time machine, and seeks to rewrite history. There is one problem: they can only do so much. One mistake can jeapordize everyting. If they get caught, or change the wrong thing, disaster is bound to happen.
        * Being discovered as resistance will get them killed in both time periods.
        * They have VERY few resources. Killing Hitler is actually really really 
          hard.
        * Travelling too far back can change history too much. They might prevent 
          their own existance.
        * They have to make sure time travell does not fall into the hands of the 
          Nazis, as this would give them an overwhelming advantage.
        
        * Fascism. Fighting against it can seem unbearably hard.
        * Struggling against the impossible.
